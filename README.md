# _Coding and Deconding_

I wanted to create a unique approach to encryption, similar to cryptography, but with a custom twist.

## What I wanted

The app should have the following functionalities:
Encode and Decode: Encrypt and decrypt messages using the custom rules.

<ul>
<li>Copy Output: Easily copy the encrypted or decrypted text.</li>
<li>Clear Button: Clear the input field without manually deleting everything.</li>
</ul>

## Learning

That was fun! I learned more about JavaScript, and I believe learning Python helped a bit. I tried using PyScript, but I don't think it's the best approach for this project.

<strong>PS:</strong> I also wanted to add a paste button. Feel free to send a pull request (PR) if you'd like to contribute!
